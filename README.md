## 3. Compare and contrast Agile and Waterfall methodologies. What are the main advantages and disadvantages of each?

Agile Methodology
Advantages:
Flexible and adaptive to changing requirements.
Encourages collaboration with continuous feedback.
Delivers working software in shorter cycles (sprints).
Promotes innovation through iterative development.

Disadvantages:
Requires active stakeholder involvement, which may be challenging.
Less suited for projects with fixed requirements.
Can become chaotic without proper structure and discipline.

Waterfall Methodology
Advantages:
Clear structure with defined stages (e.g., requirements, design, implementation).
Easier to manage timelines and budgets for fixed-scope projects.
Suitable for projects with well-defined requirements.

Disadvantages:
Limited flexibility; changes are costly and time-consuming.
Delayed testing phases may result in discovering issues late.
Progress can be slower since each phase must be completed before moving forward.

Key Differences
Flexibility: Agile is adaptive; Waterfall follows a fixed plan.
Development Style: Agile uses iterative cycles; Waterfall follows a linear sequence.
Stakeholder Involvement: Agile requires ongoing collaboration; Waterfall needs less frequent input.
Risk Management: Agile mitigates risks through frequent reviews; Waterfall identifies risks mostly upfront.



## 4. In what types of projects might Agile be more beneficial than Waterfall, and vice versa? Can you provide examples of each?

Agile – Best for ;
Dynamic Projects: Where requirements are likely to evolve.

Customer-Centric Products: Where continuous feedback and iteration are crucial.
Examples:
Mobile app development with frequent updates.
E-commerce platforms requiring constant feature changes.
Startups developing MVPs (Minimum Viable Products) with evolving needs.

Waterfall – Best for:
Well-Defined Projects: Where requirements are clear from the start.
Regulated Industries: Projects requiring extensive documentation and compliance.
Fixed Scope and Budget: Suitable when timelines and costs are strictly controlled.
Examples:
Building a banking system with precise security requirements.
Infrastructure projects like hospital management systems.
Government contracts with rigid guidelines and milestones.
